##Essential Mathematics For Programmers In Java

This project deals with various algorithms required for programmers. You must have known methods of finding prime factors, GCD, etc but performing them efficiently by reducing Time Complexity is the main motive of the project.

##Getting Started

The whole version is build in JDK 1.8, so you need to get java installed in the system. 
To check java version type in terminal
	#java -version

##Acknowledgments

This project is build by following tutorials from Youtube, an immense online learning resource.
Since most of the tutorials are taught in C/C++, Java Programmers can find it very useful.
